New functionality in this release are:
* As a part of the strategy to provide Microservices we have created the first microservioce for Data Sources. This will get, save and delete data sources,
* The server less user interface was changed to use the new data source microservice to get data sources for the home page
* Another microservice to get data configurations was created. Currently only get is supported.
* A dropdown list of taxonomies when creating a index pipeline in dataops was implemented instead of manually writing in the name of the taxonomy
* Default taxonomy to create an index has been changed to create a log curve array. With this you can of course view the log curves in a line chart viewer or table
