New functionality are:
* Implemented a new validity rule call IsEqualTo. It will fail if a value is not equal to a list of values.
* Created a new Report view that shows rules failed by a Uniqueness rule. It also shows the Uniqueness key.
* Added a button in the new Uniqueness view to merge data object with the same uniqueness key.
